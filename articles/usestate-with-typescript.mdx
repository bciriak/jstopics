## What is the state in React.js Component?

We can think of a state as a small piece of memory that holds our component's data. It can be a variable called `showModal`. This variable holds data (`boolean`) that tell our component if it should show a modal. 

This value usually changes on user input. The user clicks on the button and the modal will be shown. Let's look at a basic state example:

<CodeBlock language='typescript' fileName='App.tsx' text={`import { useState } from 'react'

function App() {
  const [showModal, setShowModal] = useState(false)

  const toggleModal = () =>  {
    setShowModal(!showModal)
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={toggleModal}>Toggle Modal</button>
      {showModal && <p>Modal</p>}
    </div>
  )
}

export default App`} />

First, we import `useState` hook from React and initialize it at the beginning of our component. As you can see, we use _array destructuring_ syntax to create the state.

<CodeBlock language='typescript' startingLineNumber={4} fileName='App.tsx' text={`const [showModal, setShowModal] = useState(false)`} />

The first element is the piece of state in our case `boolean` called `showModal` and the second element is the so-called **dispatch function** that updates this piece of state. Names of these elements should follow this naming convention: `name` and `setName`. 

Note that we gave the `useState` hook one parameter, and this is called the initial state. With a simple state like this (boolean), TypeScript will infer the type of this initial state, but we can type our `useState` if we wanted to. This would be handy with more complex data, which we will get to a bit later.

Just an aside, we can handle more complex data with another React hook, `useReducer`. <MdLink url='/reactjs/usereducer-with-typescript' text='Learn more about useReducer with TypeScript.' />

Next, we have a simple function `toggleModal`, which calls `setShowModal` function with the opposite boolean value (so that we toggle the boolean).

<CodeBlock language='typescript' fileName='App.tsx' startingLineNumber={6} text={`const toggleModal = () =>  {
  setShowModal(!showModal)
}`} />

And at last, we have our JSX with a simple button and conditionally rendered paragraph.

<CodeBlock language='typescript' fileName='App.tsx' startingLineNumber={10} text={`return (
  <div>
    <button onClick={toggleModal}>Toggle Modal</button>
    {showModal && <p>Modal</p>}
  </div>
)`} />

### Aside: useState vs variable

Some newcomers to the world of JavaScript and React might not realize the simple but very important truth about React. I know I was a bit confused when first started.

Why can't we use a regular JavaScript variable and do something like this?

<CodeBlock language='typescript' fileName='App.tsx' text={`function App() {
  let showModal = false

  const toggleModal = () =>  {
    showModal = !showModal
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={toggleModal}>Toggle Modal</button>
      {showModal && <p>Modal</p>}
    </div>
  )
}

export default App`} />

Well, simply because it will not work. React will not re-render the component.

If we were to write this piece of code in vanilla JavaScript/TypeScript, it could look something like this:

<CodeBlock language='typescript' fileName='app.ts' text={`document.querySelector<HTMLDivElement>('#app')!.innerHTML = \`
  <div id="component">
    <button id="toggler">Toggle Modal</button>
  </div>
\`

let component = document.querySelector<HTMLButtonElement>('#component')!
let button = document.querySelector<HTMLButtonElement>('#toggler')!
let modal = document.createElement('p')
modal.innerHTML = "Modal"
let showModal = false

const toggleModal = () => {
  showModal = !showModal

  if (showModal) {
    component.appendChild(modal)
  } else {
    component.removeChild(modal)
  }
}

button.addEventListener('click', () => toggleModal())`} />

Which is definitely worse looking than our React component. 

So it is important to realize, React does a ton of work for us behind the scenes. One of the big ones is, watching for changes and re-rendering UI. Aside end!

## When does React re-renders component?

If you want **great in-depth look** at how and when React re-renders, have a look at [React re-renders guide](https://www.developerway.com/posts/react-re-renders-guide). 

There are 4 reasons why React will re-render a component:

- **state changes**
- parent re-renders
- context changes
- hook changes

and `useState` hook is one of the states changes that React watches.

## useState with TypeScript

Let's have a look at 2 more use cases with a bit more complex data. One common use case is fetching data and displaying it in a component.

### Fetch data and useState

First, we define data coming from API. I am using a dummy JSON endpoint that returns objects looking like this: `{ id: string, username: string}`. This is exactly how our `User` type is gonna look like.

<CodeBlock language='typescript' fileName='App.tsx' startingLineNumber={3} text={`type User = {
  id: string
  username: string
}`} />

Now we can type our `useState` hook with this custom type and initialize it to an empty array.

<CodeBlock language='typescript' fileName='App.tsx' startingLineNumber={9} text={`const [users, setUsers] = useState<User[]>([])

// to specify what types will our array hold, we do it by writing the type and []
// array of strings => string[]
// array of Users => User[]`} />

This piece of state is gonna hold our fetched API data. We fetch the data when the component loads, which means we want to call the API in another React hook `useEffect`.

<CodeBlock language='typescript' fileName='App.tsx' startingLineNumber={11} text={`useEffect(() => {
  const fetchUsers = async () => {
    const data = await fetch('https://my-json-server.typicode.com/jstopics/placeholders/users')
    setUsers(await data.json())
  }

  fetchUsers()
}, [])`} />

By providing an empty array as a second argument in `useEffect`, we are telling it to run only once.

And the last thing is to conditionally show our data if the `User` array is not empty. Our IDE will nicely suggest properties of the user thanks to TypeScript. 

And the whole component:

<CodeBlock language='typescript' fileName='App.tsx' text={`import { useState, useEffect } from 'react'

type User = {
  id: string
  username: string
}

function App() {
  const [users, setUsers] = useState<User[]>([])

  useEffect(() => {
    const fetchUsers = async () => {
      const data = await fetch('https://my-json-server.typicode.com/jstopics/placeholders/users')
      setUsers(await data.json())
    }

    fetchUsers()
  }, [])
  
  return (
    <div>
      {users.length > 0 && <ul>
        {users.map(user => <li key={user.id}>{user.username}</li>)}
      </ul>}
    </div>
  )
}

export default App`} />

### Form data with useState and TypeScript

Another common use case is handling form data with `useState`. Simple forms can be easily handled by `useState` hook.

Again we start with defining the type of data we want to handle with our form. Let's say it's going to be a login form:

<CodeBlock language='typescript' fileName='Form.tsx' startingLineNumber={3} text={`type FormData = {
  username: string
  password: string
}`} />

And now we want to define some initial state of the form. This will also help us to reset the form after we send the data.

<CodeBlock language='typescript' fileName='Form.tsx' startingLineNumber={8} text={`const initialState: FormData = {
  username: '',
  password: ''
}`} />

These are just an empty string, as we would expect to see in the login form ðŸ˜‘ 

We can now initialize our state:

<CodeBlock language='typescript' fileName='Form.tsx' startingLineNumber={14} text={`const [formData, setFormData] = useState<FormData>(initialState)`} />

Be careful with the `FormData` type, IDE can pull in the original `FormData` type. Also, note the `initialState` parameter. And the JSX:

<CodeBlock language='typescript' fileName='Form.tsx' startingLineNumber={24} text={`return (
  <form>
    <div>
      <label htmlFor="username">Username</label>
      <input 
        type="text" 
        name="username"
        value={formData.username} 
        onChange={handleChange} 
      />
    </div>
    <div>
      <label htmlFor="password">Password</label>
      <input 
        type="password" 
        name="password"
        value={formData.password} 
        onChange={handleChange} 
      />
    </div>
    <button 
      type="button" 
      onClick={() => {console.log(formData)}}
    >
      Log In
    </button>
  </form>
)`} />

We just wire our `input` elements with our state. The last piece left to do is to implement the `onChange` event. We can create one function, that will look at the input `name` attribute and update the piece of state with that key.

<CodeBlock language='typescript' fileName='Form.tsx' startingLineNumber={16} text={`const handleChange = (e: React.ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>) => {
  e.preventDefault()
  const value = e.target.value
  const prop = e.target.name

  setFormData({...state, [prop]: value})
}`} />

The hardest part here is probably figuring out the type of the `event` if you are just starting with TypeScript and React. The thing is, there is not a piece of good advice on how to find the correct type, just search the internet. Don't worry about that, with some practice it will come easy.

Then we need to `preventDefault` because the default behavior of the form is to reload the whole page after it is submitted. Next, we assign our variables and update the state with little **object destructuring** trick `{...state, [prop]: value}`.

And the whole component:

<CodeBlock language='typescript' fileName='Form.tsx' text={`import { useState } from 'react'

type FormData = {
  username: string
  password: string
}

const initialState: FormData = {
  username: '',
  password: ''
}

function Form() {
  const [formData, setFormData] = useState<FormData>(initialState)

  const handleChange = (e: React.ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>) => {
    e.preventDefault()
    const value = e.target.value
    const prop = e.target.name

    setFormData({...state, [prop]: value})
  }

  return (
    <form>
      <div>
        <label htmlFor="username">Username</label>
        <input 
          type="text" 
          name="username"
          value={formData.username} 
          onChange={handleChange} 
        />
      </div>
      <div>
        <label htmlFor="password">Password</label>
        <input 
          type="password" 
          name="password"
          value={formData.password} 
          onChange={handleChange} 
        />
      </div>
      <button 
        type="button" 
        onClick={() => {console.log(formData)}}
      >
        Log In
      </button>
    </form>
  )
}

export default Form`} />
