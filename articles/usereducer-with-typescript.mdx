useReducer hook is one of Reacts API features that helps us manage state in React components. It has been added to react in version 16.8 along with other hooks.

## Managing state with useReducer

You can think of **`useReducer`** as older brother of **<MdLink url='/reactjs/usestate-with-typescript' text='useState' />**. Older meaning it can handle more complicated things.

Following is a diagram of simple Todo App that we will reconstruct with **`useReducer`**.

![Simple Todo App with useReducer diagram](/images/articles/usereducer-diagram.jpg 'Simple useReducer diagram')

On the left, we have mock of the app and on the right is **`useReducer`** with its 4 main parts, state, dispatch, action and reducer.

## State

Well, **state** is the _container_ that holds our information. This **state** can hold much more complex data than **`useState`**. Not that **`useState`** can't hold complex data, but its use is not suited for such a complex data.

For managing more complex state make sure to look at <MdLink url='/reactjs/react-context-typescript' text='Context API with useReducer and TypeScript.' />


## Dispatch

**Dispatch** is a special function given to us by **`useReducer`** and it is some kind of messenger between our UI and _state_. In this example we could have different changes that we would want to do to our state. Like adding a todo or removing todo. **Dispatch** is the one carrying the message what we want to do with our state. The message would be action in our case.

## Action

**Action** is plain object that specifies what we want to do with our state. Here is an example of adding a todo **action**:

<CodeBlock
  language="typescript"
  fileName="example.tsx"
  text={`{
	type: "ADD_TODO",
	todo: "Buy Milk"
}`}
/>

So dispatch is the messenger and **action** is the message.

## Reducer

Now we come to the last piece of **`useReducer`**, the brains. **Reducer** itself is where all of the logic happens. **Reducer** is pure function, that looks at action and decides how to change state. It has access to _currentState_ and that is how we update it. But we never mutate state in **reducer**, we just copy it and return new state.

## Back to the Todo App

Looking at the previous picture, we see that there is already some initial state, **todos** array. If we want to add a Todo to this array, we would click on **Add Todo** button, which would fire useReducers' **dispatch** function with appropriate action. In this case "ADD_TODO", and it would be handled by **reducer**, which would update the state. React would look at the state, see the change and re-render our UI.

Alright, to better understand how **`useReducer`** works, especially with TypeScript, let's build this simple app.

<MdLink url='/typescript/javascript-vs-typescript' text='Learn more about advantages of TypeScript.' />

## Clean React TypeScript app with Vitejs

I am gonna create barebones React TypeScript app with <MdLink url='https://vitejs.dev/' text='Vitejs' />, an amazing tool for creating Front-end applications.

If you don't know **Vite**, have a look at <MdLink url='/reactjs/vite-create-react-app' text='Create React App With Vite' />.

<Note text="To create React app with TypeScript, make sure to use this command: 'npm create vite@latest my-react-app --template react-ts'" />

First thing I will do, is to remove all the noise from **`App.tsx`** and get to this point:

<CodeBlock
  language="typescript"
  fileName="App.tsx"
  text={`function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Todos</h1>
    </div>
  )
}

export default App`}
/>

I also don't like the dummy styling included with Vite, so I just removed everything from **`index.css`**. Now if we run `npm run dev`, we should be all set.

## Adding useReducer

Let's add **`useReducer`** to our app. And we will do this in a silly way, so that we can understand it a little better.

To initialise **`useReducer`**, we need to supply 2 arguments to this hook. **Reducer** and **initial state**. As I mentioned before, **`reducer`** is pure function returning state. **`initialState`** is object holding our state/data.

<CodeBlock language="typescript" fileName="App.tsx" text={`import { useReducer } from 'react'

  const initialState = {
    todos: [],
  }

  const reducer = (state: any, action: any) => {
    return state
  }

  function App() {
  const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState)

    return (
      <div>
        <h1>Todos</h1>
        <pre>{JSON.stringify(state, null, 2)}</pre>
      </div>
    )
}

export default App`}
/>

First, we imported the **`useReducer`** hook itself from 'react'. We created **`initialState`** object with one key `todos`, initialised to an empty array. Underneath is our dummy reducer, doing only one thing right now, returning state. It also has 2 arguments (for now typed as `any`), first one is the actual **state** that we have access to in reducer and second is our **action**.

Inside our `App` component we initialise the `useReducer` with our `reducer` and `initialState`.

Last little detail is the `pre` tag, to display our state.

<Note text="JSON.stringify is function to, well, make string out of JSON. But we can nicely format the outputted string, by supplying 2 more arguments. Second argument is 'replacer' and this can be function, array or null, used in case we want to somehow manipulate the output, e.g. we don't want some of the properties to be shown in the JSON string. And the last one is 'space', meaning how we want to indent and line break characters, for better readability." />

## Using our useReducer to add a Todo

First of all, we need a button to be able to add a **Todo**.

<CodeBlock language="typescript" fileName="App.tsx" text={`<button onClick={() => dispatch({ type: 'addTodo', payload: 'Buy Milk' })}>
  Add Todo
</button>`}
/>

We are using **`dispatch`** function given to us by the hook and supplying it with hardcoded action object for now. Don't worry, we will improve this solution.

The only thing missing is now some logic in **`reducer`** that will handle the action and update state accordingly.

<CodeBlock language="typescript" fileName="App.tsx" text={`const reducer = (state: any, action: any) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'addTodo':
      let newTodos = [...state.todos, action.payload]
      return { ...state, todos: newTodos }
    default:
      throw new Error(\`Unhandled action type: \${action.type}\`)
  }
}`}
/>

For those of you familiar with <MdLink url='https://redux.js.org/' text='Redux' />, this syntax in reducer should be very simple to understand. **`switch`** statement is perfect for this situation, but you could very well use **`if else`** statement to make this logic work.

Right now we have 2 options how the `switch` can go. Default state will throw error if the `action.type` will be unknown, and `addTodo` will add new todo to our state. Remember, **we don't want to mutate the `state`**, that is why we first copy the todos from current state by destructuring it `...state.todos` and then we simply add our new todo from `action.payload` to that new array.

Last thing to do, is to copy our whole state, again by destructuring the state object and overwriting the `todos` with our **`newTodos`** array.

We should now be able to add our hardcoded todo to the state, by clicking the **_Add Todo button_**.

## Improving useReducer with typing

Looking at our `App`, besides those two **`any`** parameters in the **`reducer`** function, it is just regular old JavaScript component. It would be shame not to use the power of TypeScript, so let's get into it.

Good place to start is our **`state`**. Let's give our state proper types so that we can get some benefits of TypeScript:

<CodeBlock language="typescript" fileName="App.tsx" text={`type Todo = {
  id: number
  description: string
}

type State = {
  todos: Todo[]
}

const initialState: State = {
  todos: [],
}`}
/>

Here we created 2 simple types, **`Todo`** and **`State`**. Now we know exact structure of our todo list. Every todo needs to have an `id` and a `description`, and our `todos` array is array of those todos.

In a same way we can add types to the `reducer` function.

<CodeBlock language="typescript" fileName="App.tsx" text={`const reducer = (
  state: State,
  action: { type: string; payload: Todo }
): State => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'addTodo':
      let newTodos = [...state.todos, action.payload]
      return { ...state, todos: newTodos }
    default:
      throw new Error(\`Unhandled action type: \${action.type}\`)
  }
}`}
/>

Pretty simple, we just got rid of those **`any`** types, which by the way are never a good sign. You should never use those. Also, check out the return type of the `reducer`. It always returns **`State`**.

With this change, we also need to update the **`dispatch`** function call in our **`onClick`**. It is just a simple change of switching the payload to the correct type:

<CodeBlock language="typescript" fileName="App.tsx" text={`<button
  onClick={() =>
    dispatch({
      type: 'addTodo',
      payload: { id: 123, description: 'Buy Milk!' },
    })
  }
>
  Add Todo
</button>`}
/>

Awesome, with these changes we know what to expect in our action, and in our state.

## Adding more data to the state

Having hardcoded value as a `Todo` is truly not very useful. Let's change that by adding an **`input`** field, and handle all of it with our **`useReducer`**. But before we do that, we can improve our **`reducer`** by removing plain strings from our cases.

It is great practice to extract usages of plain strings into constants, this way we will not make simple typo and introduce bug.

<CodeBlock language="typescript" fileName="App.tsx" text={`...
const ADD_TODO = 'addTodo'
...
switch (action.type) {
	case ADD_TODO:
...`}
/>

As we will add more types of actions, we will just add corresponding constants.

Back to the **`input`** for our todo.

<CodeBlock language="typescript" fileName="App.tsx" text={`<input
  type="text"
  value={state.newTodoValue}
  onChange={(e) =>
    dispatch({
      type: UPDATE_VALUE,
      payload: { description: e.target.value },
    })
  }
/>`}
/>

This is how the **`input`** looks like. We are handling its value with our state, which we will add to `initialState` in just a second. Another thing is, the **`UPDATE_VALUE`**. This means we will need to also update our `reducer` to handle this action case.

<CodeBlock language="typescript" fileName="App.tsx" text={`...
const ADD_TODO = 'addTodo'
const UPDATE_VALUE = 'updateValue'
...
type State = {
	todos: Todo[]
	newTodoValue: string
}

const initialState: State = {
	todos: [],
	newTodoValue: '',
}
...`}
/>

This should be pretty straight forward, we just took advantage or `useReducer` and added another piece of state, which will handle the `input` value. And we just initialised it to an empty string.

Onto the **`reducer`**:

<CodeBlock language="typescript" fileName="App.tsx" text={`const reducer = (
  state: State,
  action: { type: string; payload: Todo }
): State => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case ADD_TODO:
      let newTodos = [...state.todos, action.payload]
      return { ...state, todos: newTodos, newTodoValue: '' }
    case UPDATE_VALUE:
      return { ...state, newTodoValue: action.payload.description }
    default:
      throw new Error(\`Unhandled action type: \${action.type}\`)
  }
}`}
/>

Notice that we added the **`newTodoValue`** to our `ADD_TODO` case and set it to an empty string. This is just to clear the input after we added the todo.

The **`UPDATE_VALUE`** case is just updating the input field and the description of new todo.

One last change we need to do, is the **`dispatch`** action in our button since we want to have different IDs for our todos and more importantly, we want the description to be the value of the input.

<CodeBlock language="typescript" fileName="App.tsx" text={`<button
  onClick={() =>
    dispatch({
      type: ADD_TODO,
      payload: {
        id: state.todos.length + 1,
        description: state.newTodoValue,
      },
    })
  }
>
  Add Todo
</button>`}
/>

Phew, that was quite a few small tweaks. But now we should have fully working Todo App where we **manage state with the use of `useReducer` hook and TypeScript**.

Here is the full `App` component if you want to just glance through it all at once:

<CodeBlock enableScroll={true} language="typescript" fileName="App.tsx" text={`import { useReducer } from 'react'

const ADD_TODO = 'addTodo'
const UPDATE_VALUE = 'updateValue'

type Todo = {
  id?: number
  description: string
}

type State = {
  todos: Todo[]
  newTodoValue: string
}

const initialState: State = {
  todos: [],
  newTodoValue: '',
}
const reducer = (
  state: State,
  action: { type: string; payload: Todo }
): State => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case ADD_TODO:
      let newTodos = [...state.todos, action.payload]
      return { ...state, todos: newTodos, newTodoValue: '' }
    case UPDATE_VALUE:
      return { ...state, newTodoValue: action.payload.description }
    default:
      throw new Error(\`Unhandled action type: \${action.type}\`)
  }
}

function App() {
  const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState)

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Todos</h1>
      <input
        type="text"
        value={state.newTodoValue}
        onChange={(e) =>
          dispatch({
            type: UPDATE_VALUE,
            payload: { description: e.target.value },
          })
        }
      />
      <button
        onClick={() =>
          dispatch({
            type: ADD_TODO,
            payload: {
              id: state.todos.length + 1,
              description: state.newTodoValue,
            },
          })
        }
      >
        Add Todo
      </button>
      <pre>{JSON.stringify(state, null, 2)}</pre>
    </div>
  )
}

export default App`}
/>
