The useRef hook is one of the handy React hooks that we can use to solve some of the problems that other hooks will not solve for us. Let's have a look at what are the use cases that **`useRef`** hook can help us with.

## useRef in React: Two main use cases

- grabbing a reference to DOM element to manipulate it as in vanilla JavaScript
- creating variable "container" that behaves like a mixture of plain variable in component and variable handled by **`useState`**

You can have a look at the finished code here:

- <MdLink url='https://github.com/jstopics/05-react-ts-useref' text='React useRef examples TypeScript' />

## DOM Element Reference and useRef hook

The best way to wrap our heads around these is to look at some code. Here is a basic implementation of the **`useRef`** hook grabbing DOM element ref: 

<Note text='We will also look at how to work with useRef and TypeScript in the bonus section of this article.' />

<CodeBlock language='javascript' fileName='BasicUseRef.jsx' text={`import {useRef} from 'react'

export default function BasicUseRef() {
  const spanElement = useRef()

  const changeText = () => {
    spanElement.current.innerText = 'Hello World üåç'
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={changeText}>Change Text</button>
      <span ref={spanElement}>Hi üëã</span>
    </div>
  )
}`} />

After we import **`useRef`** from React, we instantiate our **`spanElement`** constant that will point to the actual span element. **`changeText`** is a function bound to **`onClick`** event on our button below in the JSX. 

In JSX we are rendering two elements, _a button and a span_. We grab the reference to the span element with **`ref={spanElement}`** and notice the initial text: **`Hi üëã`**. Thanks to the reference, we can access native properties and methods (if the element has some) of this DOM element, in our case **`span`**, which has property **`innerText`**.

When we click on the button, the **`changeText`** function fires and changes the text of the span. You might notice we are accessing the **`innerText`** through this **`current`** property. That is what the **`useRef`** hook gives us back, object with **`current`** property.

<Note text='Thing to mention is, that changing the text of the span will not re-render our component. Give it a try, put a console.log right below the const spanElement.' />

## useRef hook as an Instance variable

Now we will have a look at the second use case for **`useRef`** hook.

<CodeBlock language='javascript' fileName='Variables.jsx' text={`import {useRef, useState} from 'react'

export default function Variables() {
  let vanillaVariable = 'Vanilla' // bad and useless ‚ùå
  const [useStateVariable, setUseStateVariable] = useState('Chocolate')
  const useRefVariable = useRef('Strawberry')

  const changeFlavor = () => {
    vanillaVariable = 'New Vanilla'
    setUseStateVariable('New Chocolate')
    useRefVariable.current = 'New Strawberry'
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <p><b>vanilla</b> Variable: {vanillaVariable}</p>
      <p><b>useState</b> Variable: {useStateVariable}</p>
      <p><b>useRef</b> Variable: {useRefVariable.current}</p>
      <button onClick={changeFlavor}>New Flavor</button>
    </div>
  )
}`} />

We are declaring variables in three different ways. The first one is a regular JavaScript variable in our component scope, the second is by using **`useState`** hook and the last one is by **`useRef`** hook.

After we click on the button we want to change our variables to have **`New`** prepended to the original text. 

Okay, this may be a really simple and dumb example but I want to point out some obvious things that can catch beginners off guard. Especially the first **`vanillaVariable`**. Due to how React handles rendering and subsequent re-renders, this variable will never a render **`New Vanilla`** text. Simply said, after React re-renders this component, our **`vanillaVariable`** will be instantiated again to the **`Vanilla`** string. This simple concept is important to understand.

## Variables with useState hook

When we click on the button, our _useState_ variable will change to the new text. We see the change on screen thanks to the re-render that React runs after this variable changes and **only** because of this reason.

## Variables with useRef hook

If we look at our **`useRefVariable`**, it also changes in the browser but that is misleading. It only happens because we are changing the **`useStateVariable`** which causes the re-render. If we remove that **`setUseStateVariable`** call from the **`changeFlavor`** function, the browser UI will not re-render, hence our _useRef_ variable will not change. 

And these are the big differences between these three variables. 

> **`useRef`** will not cause re-render, as our plain JavaScript variable definition but it will hold the new value after re-render, just as our **`setState`** variable.

## Bonus: useRef and TypeScript examples

The first example is a simple one but there are some heads up that we need to know to not get confused when using TypeScript with React hooks.

<CodeBlock language='typescript' fileName='App.tsx' text={`import {useEffect, useRef} from 'react'

export default function App() {
  const spanRef = useRef<HTMLSpanElement>(null)

  useEffect(() => {
    if (spanRef.current) {
      spanRef.current.innerText = "Hello World!"
    }
  }, [])

  return (
    <div>
      <span ref={spanRef}>Hello</span>
    </div>
  )
}`} />

There are two things to point out and these are the basics that we need to understand when working with TypeScript. <MdLink url='https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/type-declarations.html' text='Type declarations' /> and type checking. Once we handle these two, TypeScript is going to give us a ton of benefits.

On the fourth line, we are declaring what type will our **`spanRef`** be. And you might be asking, how did I know it's gonna be **`HTMLSpanElement`**? Well, I did not just guess it, I have some experience on how to figure these types out. It can get a bit frustrating when you are just starting with TypeScript, but with some practice and experience, it will get simpler.

Have a look at <MdLink url='https://microsoft.github.io/PowerBI-JavaScript/interfaces/_node_modules_typedoc_node_modules_typescript_lib_lib_dom_d_.htmlelement.html' text='this link to Microsoft website' /> where they list basic DOM Element types.

Looking at line 7, that is where we do our type checking, making sure that our **`spanRef.current`** is defined.

## useRef hook to bind events

Now we will look at the last example:

<CodeBlock language='typescript' fileName='UseRefEvent.tsx' text={`import {useRef} from 'react'

export default function UseRefElement() {
  const elementRef = useRef<HTMLButtonElement>(null)

  const handleClick = () => {
    if (elementRef.current) {
      elementRef.current.onclick = () => console.log('doing something')
    }
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={handleClick}>Bind button</button>
      <button ref={elementRef}>Ref Button</button>
    </div>
  )
}`} />

This is also a silly example, but it brings home the point of what **`useRef`** hook can do. What we do here is, basically, we bind one **`onClick`** event by clicking another button. 

Notice that on line 8 we are accessing **`current.onclick`** property of Button DOM element. That is why the syntax of _onclick_ is not a camel case as we are used to in React. The **`useRef`** hook gives us control over the whole DOM element.

## Common React interview question: Input Focus

Last example is also quite common React.js interview question. Question is, how would you focus a specific input element in React? Let's see:

<CodeBlock language='typescript' fileName='FocusInput.tsx' text={`import {useEffect, useRef} from 'react'

export default function FocusInput() {
  const inputRef = useRef<HTMLInputElement>(null)

  useEffect(() => {
    if (inputRef.current) {
      inputRef.current.focus()
    }
  })

  return (
    <div>
      <input type="text"/>
      <input type="text"/>
      <input ref={inputRef} type="text"/>
      <input type="text"/>
    </div>
  )
}`} />

Again, this is simple if you know the **`useRef`** hook. We have 4 inputs in our JSX and let's say we want to focus the third one on the page load. All we need to do is grab a reference to the input that we want to control and call the native function **`focus()`** on the **`current`** object that **`useRef`** provides for us.

These were some very simple examples of **`useRef`** hook usage with TypeScript, if you would like me to write more complex TypeScript usage with React.js hooks, let me know in the comments below. 

Thank you for reading.
