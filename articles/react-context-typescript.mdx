### Too many state management libraries

Application state management can feel a bit overwhelming for beginner React developers, especially if they have to pick one of the many libraries we have nowadays. <a href="https://redux.js.org/" target="_blank" alt="Official Redux website" >Redux</a>? <a href="https://mobx.js.org/README.html" target="_blank" alt="Official Mobx website" >Mobx</a>? <a href="https://jotai.org/" target="_blank" alt="Official Jotai website" >Jotai</a>? <a href="https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand" target="_blank" alt="Official Zustand website" >Zustand</a>? 

As you might already know, there is one more choice and it is the **Context API**. It comes with React, so we don't have to install anything to manage our global application state.

## Advantages and disadvantages of Reacts' Context API

#### Advantages
- as just mentioned, it comes with React which means we don't need to install anything else = smaller app build
- Context API is quite powerful and it can handle complex global app state with its partner in crime, useReducer
- although it can handle complex state, it might be suited for simple state management alongside data fetching library like **React Query**
- can help us with anti-patterns like prop drilling

#### Disadvantages
- when the state gets too complicated, it can get a bit messy with all the providers and wrapping of our components
- more boilerplate than some alternatives

## useContext example with TypeScript

One very common use case for Context API is to manage our application theme/mode. Let's see how we can manage it with `useContext` and `useState`.

[Learn more about usage of useState with TypeScript.](/reactjs/usestate-with-typescript)

Here is a GitHub repo to a starter React app created with Vite, if you want to follow along just clone it:

<a href="https://github.com/jstopics/react-starter" target="_blank" alt="Vite Starter App" >Vite Starter App</a>

## createContext with TypeScript

First we need to create our `ThemeContext` and give it a type of `Theme`.

```tsx title="./App.tsx"
type Theme = {
  darkMode: boolean
  toggleTheme: () => void
}

const ThemeContext = createContext<Theme | null>(null)
```

The `Theme` type has two properties, first one is `boolean` to track the state of our theme and second, `toggleTheme` is function that will actually change the state.

Now we can use it in our `App` component. There is one thing we need to understand about Context, it is basically a container that will hold values specified by us. In case of the `ThemeContext`, we will assign it a `useState` piece that will also update the context by `setState` function.

```tsx title="./App.tsx"
const [darkMode, setDarkMode] = useState(false)
```

Simple `useState` to hold the boolean value and to update the value.

Now if we want to use the context, we need to wrap a component with it. By doing so, we enable the `ThemeContext` in that component and all of its' children.

```tsx title="./App.tsx"
<ThemeContext.Provider
  value={{
	darkMode,
	toggleTheme: () => setDarkMode(!darkMode),
  }}
>
  <div className="container mx-auto">
    <h1>React + Vite + TypeScript + Tailwind + Prettier</h1>
    <button className="btn bg-yellow-400" onClick={() => setDarkMode(!darkMode)}>
      {darkMode ? 'Dark Mode' : 'Light Mode'}
    </button>
  </div>
</ThemeContext.Provider>
```

Here we have wrapped the `div` in `ThemeContext.Provider` and added `button` to toggle between the Light and Dark mode.

Here is the whole component:

```tsx title="./App.tsx" showLineNumbers
import { createContext, useEffect, useState } from 'react'

type Theme = {
  darkMode: boolean
  toggleTheme: () => void
}

const ThemeContext = createContext<Theme | null>(null)

function App() {
  const [darkMode, setDarkMode] = useState(false)

  useEffect(() => {
    if (darkMode) {
      document.body.classList.add('dark')
    } else {
      document.body.classList.remove('dark')
    }
  }, [darkMode])

  return (
    <ThemeContext.Provider
      value={{
        darkMode,
        toggleTheme: () => setDarkMode(!darkMode),
      }}
    >
      <div className="container mx-auto">
        <h1>React + Vite + TypeScript + Tailwind + Prettier</h1>
        <button className="btn bg-yellow-400" onClick={() => setDarkMode(!darkMode)}>
          {darkMode ? 'Dark Mode' : 'Light Mode'}
        </button>
      </div>
    </ThemeContext.Provider>
  )
}

export default App
```

The `useEffect` that we are using is only adding and removing class to our `body` tag, which adds these styles:

```css title="index.css"
.dark {
  @apply bg-gray-800 text-white;
}

.btn {
  @apply px-4 py-2 my-1 rounded-md;
}
```

If we now start up the app, we should be able to toggle between the themes. This basic example shows how to use `Context` with TypeScript and `useState` for simple use cases.

## Complex global state with useContext and TypeScript

Now that we have seen the very basic usage of Context API with TypeScript, let's look at something more powerful. To enable the full power of Context, we will use two React hooks, `useContext` and `useReducer`.

`useReducer` is ideal for handling complex state and `useContext` is great for exposing it globally throughout our application.

We will add a very simple job board to our application and refactor the `ThemeContext` to go along with `JobsContext`. This new context will handle CRUD operations (without update) of our job board.

First, let's refactor `ThemeContext` by moving it to separate file in `contexts` folder within the `src`.

```tsx title="./contexts/ThemeContext.tsx" showLineNumbers
import { useContext, createContext, useState } from 'react'

type Theme = {
  darkMode: boolean
  toggleTheme: () => void
}

const ThemeContext = createContext<Theme | null>(null)

export function ThemeProvider({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
  const [darkMode, setDarkMode] = useState(false)

  return (
    <ThemeContext.Provider
      value={{
        darkMode,
        toggleTheme: () => setDarkMode(!darkMode),
      }}
    >
      {children}
    </ThemeContext.Provider>
  )
}

export function useTheme() {
  const context = useContext(ThemeContext)
  if (context === null) {
    throw new Error('useTheme must be used within a ThemeProvider')
  }
  return context
}
```

Here we are creating and exporting `ThemeProvider` that will wrap our `App` component so that we can use this context. We are also exporting `useTheme` hook, which exposes the `state` and `toggle` function.

Now we can simplify the `App` component with this new standalone `ThemeContext`.

```tsx title="./App.tsx" 
import { useEffect } from 'react'
import { useTheme } from './contexts/ThemeContext'

function App() {
  const { darkMode, toggleTheme } = useTheme()

  useEffect(() => {
    if (darkMode) {
      document.body.classList.add('dark')
    } else {
      document.body.classList.remove('dark')
    }
  }, [darkMode])

  return (
    <div className="container mx-auto">
      <h1>React + Vite + TypeScript + Tailwind + Prettier</h1>
      <button className="btn bg-yellow-400" onClick={toggleTheme}>
        {darkMode ? 'Dark Mode' : 'Light Mode'}
      </button>
    </div>
  )
}

export default App
```

We just need to import our `useTheme` hook and we are good to go. Thanks to TypeScript we are getting our two properties that we defined in our `Theme` type.

If we would try to run the app now, we would get the `useTheme must be used within a ThemeProvider` error defined in our hook. To fix this, we need to wrap our `App` component with `ThemeProvider`.

```tsx title="./main.tsx" showLineNumbers
import React from 'react'
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client'
import App from './App'
import { ThemeProvider } from './contexts/ThemeContext'
import './index.css'

ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root') as HTMLElement).render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <ThemeProvider> // wrapping the App component
      <App />
    </ThemeProvider>
  </React.StrictMode>
)
```

And the refactor of `ThemeContext` is done. Onto the job board.

### UI Components for Job Board

First we will create couple of basic components to have our UI prepared.

```tsx title="./JobBoard.tsx" showLineNumbers
import AddJob from './components/AddJob'
import JobDetail from './components/JobDetail'
import JobList from './components/JobList'

export default function JobBoard() {
  return (
    <div className="wrapper">
      <div className="flex justify-between">
        <h1 className="text-2xl">Job Board</h1>
      </div>
      <div className="flex">
        <JobList />
        <JobDetail />
      </div>
      <AddJob />
    </div>
  )
}
```

`JobBoard` is sitting in `src` directory and is a parent component to the three parts of the board, all created in `components` folder inside the `src`:

```tsx title="./components/JobList.tsx" showLineNumbers
import { useTheme } from '../contexts/ThemeContext'

export default function JobList() {
  const darkMode = useTheme().darkMode

  return (
    <div className={\`wrapper w-1/4 $\{darkMode ? 'bg-gray-700' : ''}\`}>
      <h3 className="text-xl">Job List</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>React Developer</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  )
}
```

`JobList` will display the list of jobs in a kind of sidebar.

```tsx title="./components/JobDetail.tsx"
export default function JobDetail() {
  return (
    <div className="wrapper w-3/4">
      <h3 className="text-xl">Job Details</h3>
      <p>Title: React Developer</p>
      <p>Is Active: 'Yes'</p>
      <button>Delete Job</button>
    </div>
  )
}
```

`JobDetail` will show selected `Job` and will provide options to read, delete and update single job.

```tsx title="./components/AddJob.tsx" showLineNumbers
export default function AddJob() {
  return (
    <div className="wrapper">
      <h1>Add Job</h1>
      <div>
        <label>Title</label>
        <input className="border dark:text-black" type="text" value={''} />
      </div>
      <button className="btn bg-blue-400">Add Job</button>
    </div>
  )
}
```

`AddJob` is a single `input` component to add job by writing its' title. There was also small change in the `index.css` file:

```css title="./index.css" showLineNumbers
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;

.dark {
  @apply bg-gray-800 text-white;
}

.btn {
  @apply px-4 py-2 my-1 rounded-md;
}

.wrapper {
  @apply border p-2 m-1;
}
```

Now we can add the `JobBoard` component to our `App` component right under the toggle theme button:

```tsx title="./App.tsx"
...
    <div className="container mx-auto">
      <h1>React + Vite + TypeScript + Tailwind + Prettier</h1>
      <button className="btn bg-yellow-400" onClick={toggleTheme}>
        {darkMode ? 'Dark Mode' : 'Light Mode'}
      </button>
      <JobBoard /> // < = = = JobBoard
    </div>
...
```

Alright, now if we look at the app, we see our little Job Board and we can toggle the light and dark mode. Before we move on, we need some placeholder JSON data for couple of Jobs to simulate API call, when our app loads for the first time. 

Create a new file `data.json` in the root of the project with following data:

```json title="../data.json" showLineNumbers
{
  "jobs": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "title": "Full Stack Engineer",
      "isActive": true
    },
    {
      "id": 2,
      "title": "React Developer",
      "isActive": true
    }
  ]
}
```

Perfect, now onto the meat of the article, `JobsContext`. To handle CRUD operations in our context, we will use aforementioned React hook made just for this, `useReducer`.

[Learn more about how to use the useReducer with TypeScript](/reactjs/usereducer-with-typescript)

First we will create our types. One for the `Job`, based on the JSON data structure and one for the `JobAction`.

```tsx title="./contexts/JobsContext.tsx" showLineNumbers
export type Job = {
  title: string
  isActive: boolean
}

type JobAction =
  | {
      type: 'SET_JOBS'
      payload: Job[]
    }
  | {
      type: 'ADD_JOB' | 'REMOVE_JOB'
      payload: Job
    }
```

We are exporting `Job` type because we will need it in our components. For the `JobAction` type, we are using <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/everyday-types.html#union-types" target="_blank" alt='TypeScript Union type'>union</a> to specify the different `payload`. Now we can create our contexts.

```tsx title="./context/JobsContext.tsx"
const JobsContext = createContext<Job[] | null>(null)
const JobsDispatchContext = createContext<React.Dispatch<JobAction>>(
  {} as React.Dispatch<JobAction>
)
```

The first context is just a container to hold our array of jobs and the second one is for interacting with it through dispatching actions. Now to the brains of this context, `jobsReducer`.

```tsx title="./context/JobsContext.tsx"
function jobsReducer(jobs: Job[], action: JobAction): Job[] {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'SET_JOBS':
      return [...(action.payload as Job[])]
    case 'ADD_JOB':
      return [...jobs, action.payload as Job]
    case 'REMOVE_JOB':
      return [...jobs.filter((job) => job.title !== action.payload.title)]
    default:
      return jobs
  }
}
```

We are missing action for updating the job for the sake of making the reducer a bit more simple. Feel free to add the action later as an exercise.

Now we are ready to create the last 3 exports that will actually be used throughout our application. `JobsProvider` for providing our contexts and 2 hooks to enable interacting with these contexts.

```tsx title="./context/JobsContext.tsx"
export function JobsProvider({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
  const [jobs, dispatch] = useReducer(jobsReducer, [])

  return (
    <JobsContext.Provider value={jobs}>
      <JobsDispatchContext.Provider value={dispatch}>
        {children}
      </JobsDispatchContext.Provider>
    </JobsContext.Provider>
  )
}
```

Here we are using the `useReducer` function and supplying it with the `jobsReducer` and as initial state we give it and empty array. This provider is a simple component that just wraps `children` with both of our contexts.

Note how we divide variables coming from `useReducer` hook into each of the `Contexts`.

Last thing to do is to create our hooks.

```tsx title="./context/JobsContext.tsx"
export function useJobs() {
  const context = useContext(JobsContext)
  if (context === null) {
    throw new Error('useJobs must be used within a JobsContext')
  }
  return context
}

export function useJobsDispatch() {
  const context = useContext(JobsDispatchContext)
  if (context === null) {
    throw new Error('useJobsDispatch must be used within a JobsDispatchContext')
  }
  return context
}
```

And finally, the whole `JobsContext`:

```tsx title="./context/JobsContext.tsx" showLineNumbers
import { createContext, useContext, useReducer } from 'react'

export type Job = {
  title: string
  isActive: boolean
}

type JobAction =
  | {
      type: 'SET_JOBS'
      payload: Job[]
    }
  | {
      type: 'ADD_JOB' | 'REMOVE_JOB'
      payload: Job
    }

const JobsContext = createContext<Job[] | null>(null)
const JobsDispatchContext = createContext<React.Dispatch<JobAction>>(
  {} as React.Dispatch<JobAction>
)

function jobsReducer(jobs: Job[], action: JobAction): Job[] {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'SET_JOBS':
      return [...(action.payload as Job[])]
    case 'ADD_JOB':
      return [...jobs, action.payload as Job]
    case 'REMOVE_JOB':
      return [...jobs.filter((job) => job.title !== action.payload.title)]
    default:
      return jobs
  }
}

export function JobsProvider({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
  const [jobs, dispatch] = useReducer(jobsReducer, [])

  return (
    <JobsContext.Provider value={jobs}>
      <JobsDispatchContext.Provider value={dispatch}>
        {children}
      </JobsDispatchContext.Provider>
    </JobsContext.Provider>
  )
}

export function useJobs() {
  const context = useContext(JobsContext)
  if (context === null) {
    throw new Error('useJobs must be used within a JobsContext')
  }
}

export function useJobsDispatch() {
  const context = useContext(JobsDispatchContext)
  if (context === null) {
    throw new Error('useJobsDispatch must be used within a JobsDispatchContext')
  }
}
```

Now we can use our awesome new context to manage application state!

First up, let's fix our `JobList`, so it actually "fetches" jobs from the JSON file and shows them in the list.

```tsx title="./components/JobList.tsx" showLineNumbers
import { useEffect } from 'react'
import { useTheme } from '../contexts/ThemeContext'
import data from '../../data.json'
import { Job, useJobs, useJobsDispatch } from '../contexts/JobsContext'

export default function JobList() {
  const darkMode = useTheme().darkMode
  const dispatch = useJobsDispatch()
  const jobs = useJobs()

  useEffect(() => {
    if (jobs.length <= 0) {
      dispatch({ type: 'SET_JOBS', payload: data.jobs })
    }
  }, [])

  return (
    <div className={\`wrapper w-1/4 $\{darkMode ? 'bg-gray-700' : ''}\`}>
      <h3 className="text-xl">Job List</h3>
      {jobs.length > 0 ? (
        <ul>
          {jobs.map((job: Job) => (
            <li key={job.title}>{job.title}</li>
          ))}
        </ul>
      ) : (
        <p>No jobs found.</p>
      )}
    </div>
  )
}
```

We import our two hooks. Inside the `useEffect` we look at the `jobs` coming from `JobsContext` and if there are no jobs, we dispatch `SET_JOBS` action with the payload of `data.jobs` coming from the JSON file. Here we could call an API to fetch real data and initialise our context data.

Once the `useEffect` runs, we check if we have some jobs in the array and if we do, we map over them and display them in `ul>li` elements. If there are no jobs, we let the user know that there were no jobs found.

If we would try to run the app, we would get an error. You know why? Well we didn't provide our context anywhere. Let's do that by wrapping the app component with it.

```tsx title="./main.tsx"
<ThemeProvider>
  <JobsProvider>
    <App />
  </JobsProvider>
</ThemeProvider>
```

And don't forget to import the `ThemeProvider` at the top of the file. When we run the app now, we should see our 2 jobs in the list. Awesome!

Let's handle adding jobs.

```tsx title="./components/AddJob.tsx"
const [job, setJob] = useState<Job>({
  title: '',
  isActive: true,
})
const dispatch = useJobsDispatch()
```

We use `useState` hook to keep track of the `Job` variable within `AddJob` component. This would be even more handy, if `Job` type would have more properties and the form would be more complex. `dispatch` function will be used to send action to our context.

```tsx title="./components/AddJob.tsx"
    <div className="wrapper">
      <h1>Add Job</h1>
      <div>
        <label>Title</label>
        <input
          className="border dark:text-black"
          type="text"
          value={job.title}
          onChange={handleTitleChange}
        />
      </div>
      <button className="btn bg-blue-400" onClick={handleAddJob}>
        Add Job
      </button>
    </div>
```

Here we set the `input` value to the title of the job variable and add `onChange` handler. We also wire up `onClick` to handle adding a job. Here are those handle functions:

```tsx title="./components/AddJob.tsx"
  const handleTitleChange = (e: React.ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>) => {
    setJob({ ...job, title: e.target.value })
  }
  
  const handleAddJob = () => {
    if (job.title !== '') {
      dispatch({ type: 'ADD_JOB', payload: job })
      setJob({ ...job, title: '' })
    }
  }
```

The `handleTitleChange` is just updating the title of job and the `handleAddJob` is dispatching `ADD_JOB` action with the job as a payload. After the action is dispatched, we set the title of the job to an empty string.

Here is the complete `AddJob` component:

```tsx title="./components/AddJob.tsx" showLineNumbers
import { useState } from 'react'
import { Job, useJobsDispatch } from '../contexts/JobsContext'

export default function AddJob() {
  const [job, setJob] = useState<Job>({
    title: '',
    isActive: true,
  })
  const dispatch = useJobsDispatch()

  const handleTitleChange = (e: React.ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>) => {
    setJob({ ...job, title: e.target.value })
  }

  const handleAddJob = () => {
    if (job.title !== '') {
      dispatch({ type: 'ADD_JOB', payload: job })
      setJob({ ...job, title: '' })
    }
  }

  return (
    <div className="wrapper">
      <h1>Add Job</h1>
      <div>
        <label>Title</label>
        <input
          className="border dark:text-black"
          type="text"
          value={job.title}
          onChange={handleTitleChange}
        />
      </div>
      <button className="btn bg-blue-400" onClick={handleAddJob}>
        Add Job
      </button>
    </div>
  )
}
```

With these changes, we are able to add new jobs to our job list. Last thing to do, is to fix our `JobDetail` component. In this component we want to show details of selected job and also have the delete job button.

```tsx title="./components/JobDetail.tsx"
type Props = {
  job: Job | null
  setSelectedJob: (job: Job | null) => void
}
```

We define `Props` for our component. First is the `job` that we want details of, second is function to clear the job after we remove it. Both of these will be sent down from the `JobBoard` component.

```tsx title="./components/JobDetail.tsx"
  const dispatch = useJobsDispatch()

  const handleRemoveJob = () => {
    if (job) {
      dispatch({ type: 'REMOVE_JOB', payload: job })
      setSelectedJob(null)
    }
  }
```

Again, we use `dispatch` to remove job from our context and `setSelectedJob` to unselect job.

```tsx title="./components/JobDetail.tsx"
    <div className="wrapper w-3/4">
      {job ? (
        <>
          <h3 className="text-xl">Job Details</h3>
          <p>Title: {job.title}</p>
          <p>Is Active: {job.isActive ? 'Yes' : 'No'}</p>
          <button className="btn bg-red-500" onClick={handleRemoveJob}>
            Delete Job
          </button>
        </>
      ) : (
        <>
          <p>Select a job.</p>
        </>
      )}
    </div>
```

And this is the JSX, we are checking for a job, if we don't have any job selected, we inform the user to `Select a job`. If we do have a job, we display the details and also wire up `onClick` event on the delete `button`.

Here is the whole `JobDetail` component:

```tsx title="./components/JobDetail.tsx" showLineNumbers
import { Job, useJobsDispatch } from '../contexts/JobsContext'

type Props = {
  job: Job | null
  setSelectedJob: (job: Job | null) => void
}

export default function JobDetail({ job, setSelectedJob }: Props) {
  const dispatch = useJobsDispatch()

  const handleRemoveJob = () => {
    if (job) {
      dispatch({ type: 'REMOVE_JOB', payload: job })
      setSelectedJob(null)
    }
  }

  return (
    <div className="wrapper w-3/4">
      {job ? (
        <>
          <h3 className="text-xl">Job Details</h3>
          <p>Title: {job.title}</p>
          <p>Is Active: {job.isActive ? 'Yes' : 'No'}</p>
          <button className="btn bg-red-500" onClick={handleRemoveJob}>
            Delete Job
          </button>
        </>
      ) : (
        <>
          <p>Select a job.</p>
        </>
      )}
    </div>
  )

And the last thing to do is to adjust `JobBoard` so that it supplies the `job` and `setSelectedJob` props to `JobDetail`. Plus we need to adjust `JobList` to enable selecting a job.

```tsx title="./JobBoard.tsx" showLineNymbers
import { useState } from 'react' 
import { Job } from './contexts/JobsContext'
import AddJob from './components/AddJob'
import JobDetail from './components/JobDetail'
import JobList from './components/JobList'

export default function JobBoard() {
  const [selectedJob, setSelectedJob] = useState<Job | null>(null)

  return (
    <div className="wrapper">
      <div className="flex justify-between">
        <h1 className="text-2xl">Job Board</h1>
      </div>
      <div className="flex">
        <JobList setSelectedJob={setSelectedJob} />
        <JobDetail job={selectedJob} setSelectedJob={setSelectedJob} />
      </div>
      <AddJob />
    </div>
  )
}
```

We use `useState` to handle the `selectedJob` and than we forward those variables down to the `JobDetail` and `JobList`.

Last small addition to `JobList` and we are done.

```tsx title="./components/JobList.tsx"
type Props = {
  setSelectedJob: (job: Job) => void
}
...
export default function JobList({ setSelectedJob }: Props) {
...
	<li onClick={() => setSelectedJob(job)} key={job.title}>
		{job.title}
	</li>
...
```

Great job, with these changes, we should now have working application with state management handled with **Context API, useReducer and TypeScript**.

Nice exercise could be to handle the `selectedJob` in our `JobsContext`, so that we don't have to send it down via props. Give it a go if you have any capacity left after this long article.
