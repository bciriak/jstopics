- Live Server extension in VSCode (or similar)
- Have Novice understanding of Web Development

## So what is React.js actually?

Let's say you want to build a web application like Netflix (which was actually built with React.js). There is ton of problems you have to solve, but one great tool you can use for the front-end is React.js. **React is** a JavaScript library, meaning, it's **a set of tools and functions designed to help us with the development of JavaScript web applications** and complex user interfaces.

First we need to understand what JavaScript libraries are and how we can add them to websites. Let's take old but popular JavaScript library <MdLink url='https://jquery.com/' text='jQuery' />. It is a set of tools that enables us to manipulate and work with the DOM (HTML elements, events etc.). With <MdLink url='https://reactjs.org/' text='React.js' /> , we can do MUCH more than with jQuery. On to the React example.

## Say "Hello World!" with React

Let's create the most basic website. You can have a look at the finished "application" in this <MdLink url='https://github.com/jstopics/01-what-is-reactjs' text='GitHub repository' />.

We will need to create two files, one **`index.html`** file, and one **`index.js`** file. Here are the contents of those files.

NOTE: Some of you might be asking why don't we create React app with tools like **create-react-app** or **vite**. Don't worry, we will get to that.

<CodeBlock
	language='html'
	fileName='index.html'
	text={`<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
	<head>
		<title>What is React.js?</title>
	</head>
	<body>
		<div id="root"></div>
		<script src="/index.js"></script>
	</body>
</html>`}
/>

And here is the JavaScript file:

<CodeBlock
	language='javascript'
	fileName='index.js'
	text={`console.log('We are in!')`}
/>

These are barebones files to add JavaScript to our website. After opening the **`index.html`** with <MdLink url='https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer' text='Live Server' /> extension and following the address Live Server gives you in the browser, we will see _We are in!_, in the browser console.

If you don't see it, make sure you meet all requirements specified at the beginning of this article.

## On to the React.js!

Now we can add React to our barebone website. We are gonna add it by importing it from <MdLink url='https://reactjs.org/docs/cdn-links.html' text='CDN links provided at React.js website' />. We simply add these at the bottom of our HTML file **ABOVE** the script importing **`index.js`**. **It is very important where we add these scripts, since we are gonna be using tools from React library!**

<CodeBlock
language='html'
fileName='index.html'
text={`<!DOCTYPE html>

<html lang="en">
	<head>
		<title>What is React.js?</title>
	</head>
	<body>
		<div id="root"></div>
		<!-- IMPORTANT TO ADD THE LINKS UNDER THE #ROOT DIV -->
		<script src="https://unpkg.com/react/umd/react.development.js"></script>
		<script src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom/umd/react-dom.development.js"></script>
		<!-- IMPORTANT TO ADD THE LINKS ABOVE THE INDEX.JS SCRIPT -->
		<script src="/index.js"></script>
	</body>
</html>`}
/>

Great, now when we refresh our website in the browser and look in the console, we should only see our `We are in!` logged in console, no errors or warnings. If that is the case, we can now add 2 lines of React code that will show `Hello World!` in the browser.

<CodeBlock
language='javascript'
fileName='index.js'
text={`const divElement = document.getElementById('root')
const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(divElement)

root.render(React.createElement('p', null, 'Hello World!'))`}
/>

That is a piece of confusing code, let's try to decypher it. The first line should be familiar to many of you. There is no React, it is simply native browser JavaScript. We are selecting element in our **`index.html`** file that we marked with an ID of **`root`**.

### ReactDOM createRoot

The second line is how React hooks into that specified element and identifies where in **`index.html`** file will our React code go. We can think about the root as portal, where all of our React code will be 'ported'.

The thing to understand is, we can have big complicated HTML file and add a piece of React.js only to say Footer on our page. It is not how we generaly use React, but we can do that. React apps look more like what we have now in the **`index.html`** file. We take control of the whole DOM.

### React create element

That was a long aside. Back to the code, last line is probably the most complicated to understand. We are telling the `root` to render some element or something. Well **`React.createElement`** is how we create React elements which are small building blocks that compose our Components.

<Note text='`createElement` method takes 3 arguments, first, tagName which can be `div, p, button...` HTML element or such. Second argument is `props` and the last one is `children`.' />

If we look at the browser now, we should see **`Hello World!`**, and if we inspect that text, unsuprisingly, we see the **`p`** tag inside **`div`** with the id of **root**. Pretty cool.

## React tooling is complex

One last thing I want to clear out is, when building bigger and more complex React.js apps we always use **bundlers, compilers, polyfills and many other handy tools**. That is why we want to create our apps with tools like <MdLink url='https://create-react-app.dev/' text='create-react-app' /> or <MdLink url='https://vitejs.dev/' text='vite' />. These are command line applications that set everything up for us and we don't need to configure complicated tools like [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) or [Babel](https://babeljs.io/).

To see how we can start project with one of those handy CLI tools, have a look at the following article: <MdLinkInternal url='/articles/vite-create-react-app' text='Starting a React project with Vite' />.
