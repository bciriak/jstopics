excerpt: 'Web frameworks are driving modern development. We have a ton of front-end and back-end frameworks to choose from, but what really are web frameworks?'
intro: 'Starting with web development today is more complex than ever before. This is partly due to the explosion of web frameworks available to us as developers. JavaScript especially brought this trend. There is even website counting how many days since last JS framework has been released. But what is a web framework?'

## What is (web) framework?

A web framework or a framework is a kind of structure that can be used to build something. In the case of web frameworks, these help us build the web. When you decide to use some web framework for your next project, you get a set of tools and best practices that help you with common tasks.

Most web frameworks have a standard way of how to go about solving problems that are typical for web applications. Some frameworks force these conventions on developers more than others and in many cases that is a good thing. Oftentimes, these conventions are created by skilled teams of developers. Such examples are, <MdLink url='https://nextjs.org/' text='Next.js' />, <MdLink url='https://rubyonrails.org/' text='Ruby on Rails' /> or <MdLink url='https://laravel.com/' text='Laravel' />. These are some of the popular frameworks developed by very bright people.

Imagine you want to add basic routing to your website with no framework. Well, it is certainly possible, but the amount of development effort would be just unreasonably high. It is much better to choose some framework and stick with the solutions for routing it offers. Faster development and higher quality of code as it is usually battle tested by many smart developers.

## Why do we need web frameworks?

As just stated in the previous paragraph, standards and conventions for certain problems are one of the main reasons why to use web frameworks. This goes hand in hand with the development speed. Some frameworks will set up CRUD applications in seconds or minutes.

Many languages were designed to build the web. Let’s take an example with PHP. One has all the tools within the language to build a web application, but doing common tasks like connecting to a database, without a framework like Laravel is much harder and much more time-consuming. That’s why we use frameworks to simplify these necessary tasks, so we can concentrate on the main application functionality.

<MdLink url='https://expressjs.com/' text='Express.js' /> is one of many JavaScript
frameworks that let us easily build application APIs, handle resources, and more.

## Web app stack - client, application, and database

The main reason for writing this article was to differentiate between frameworks. Lot of times we see comparisons like, which framework is better, React.js or Express.js? Node.js or Laravel, etc.? The point is, that these tools are very different from each other. Yes, you certainly can call them frameworks, in a way, these all are frameworks, but they are different species of frameworks.

To see the difference between them, we need a firm understanding of the web application stack. I am gonna use very simple terms here and divide the stack into three basic tiers. **Database, server, and client**. This organization of tiers helps us see how data flows within our application. From database to the server and then to the client, which can be a browser, mobile application, desktop software, etc.

And since 99% of the code is written on the server and client level, gazillion web frameworks for these two tiers were developed throughout the years. Now, the general division is server-side and client-side frameworks. ![List of different kinds of web frameworks](/images/articles/web-frameworks.jpeg 'Different web frameworks')

## Server-side vs. Client-side

Server-side or backend is where the actual web frameworks started. Languages like C#, Java, Python, or PHP were used for building web applications. The need for some “standardized” way of developing web apps brought frameworks like .NET, Django, CakePHP, and these are what we call backend frameworks. With these frameworks, we handle requests, and data validation, work with the filesystem and serve HTML webpages. Node.js enabled JavaScript on the backend and this brought JavaScript frameworks like Express.js, Koa.js, and others. On the other hand, we have client-side frameworks.

Client-side frameworks or front-end frameworks started popping up when Node.js and NPM started gaining traction. Front-end frameworks are almost exclusively JavaScript frameworks like React.js, VueJS, Svelte and more. These frameworks are different from backend technologies because they work within the browser. We ask for data through our application web API and once we have the data we need, we can do all sorts of magic on the front-end. Routing, manipulating the data, UI rendering. These kinds of apps are also called Single Page Applications.

## Single Page Applications - SPAs

The main reason for creating Single Page Applications is user experience. SPA asks the server for some data and necessary assets, and once it receives the data, the page is loaded a single time. The frontend framework like <MdLink url='https://reactjs.org/' text='React.js' /> takes over the page and does all the page interactions. This enables a very seamless, desktop-like user experience. No page reloads, no waiting for responses, etc. There is much more to SPAs and if you want to learn a bit more read my <MdLinkInternal url='/web-frameworks/single-page-application-example' text='article on Single Page Applications' />.
